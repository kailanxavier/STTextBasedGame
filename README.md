# The Strawberry Thief 🍓

### 🎮 About the game
Strawberry Thief is a text-based adventure game where the player can choose from a few different options, which decide their fate. The goal is to collect as many strawberries as possible and return to the kingdom safely.

### 🌿 Backstory
Long ago, the Kingdom of Eldora thrived on its magical strawberry fields, known for their healing and energizing properties. However, a group of mischievous forest creatures has stolen most of the precious strawberries, hiding them deep within the Enchanted Woods. As the bravest gatherer in the land, you have been tasked by the King to reclaim as many strawberries as possible and return safely. But beware—the forest is filled with traps, cunning tricksters, and secrets waiting to be uncovered. Will you outwit the perils of the wild and bring prosperity back to Eldora?

### 🗝️ Key-features
- Command-based gameplay: The player must enter their choice and each choice branches into other choices. For example, if the player chooses to explore the forest the program will generate a random encounter. Currently, the player can encounter a Serpent of Fire, a Polar Bear, a Mind Wizard, a chest with a random item, or a lost strawberry on the ground. 
- Multiple endings: If you decide to try your luck and go back to the kingdom before acquiring the 10 strawberries you were tasked with finding, something not so good may happen to you. Alternatively, your fate may be in the hands of the beasts you find in your path.
