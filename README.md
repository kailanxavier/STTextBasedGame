# The Strawberry Thief

In this game the player will have to fight a random
enemy determined by the machine at the start of each
round, and then branch into what attack to use against
each enemy, depending on the attack the player chooses
they will either do an amount of damage or take an
amount of damage. Each dead enemy has a 75% chance of
containing a strawberry. The player's goal is to collect
as many strawberries as they can before their health
get to 0. The player can find multiple items when
looting dead bodies including healing potions, which
add x amount of health to their health bars.

Other attributes that would be nice to have after the
game is finished includes things such as fatigue, hunger
and strength. Fatigue can be cured by finding a bed and
choosing to sleep, otherwise each fight will decrease the
player's fatigue meter no matter if they won the fight or
not. Hunger also decreases and the player must find food
by looting villages or abandoned houses. Strength is gained
when the player fights an opponent.
